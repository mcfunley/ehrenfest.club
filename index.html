    <h1>Ehrenfest&#39;s Urn</h1>
    <h3>An illustration of entropy&#39;s increase in the direction of time we call the future.</h3>
    <p>
      This is a simulation of two gases mixing through a small opening between
      two boxes. Initially very low in entropy (that is, the two distinct gases
      are separated), the system evolves to the higher entropy state in which the
      gases are mixed.
